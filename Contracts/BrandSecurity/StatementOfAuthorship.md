## 1. Declaration
I, **Commander Flame (Andrew Davis)**, affirm authorship and original creative contribution to the following materials:

- AI-generated works directed by my prompts  
- Branding elements (logos, banners, seals, emblems)  
- Frameworks and systems inside Flame Division MusicAI  

## 2. AI-Assisted Creation
Where AI is used:
- Tools are considered **assistive**, not autonomous authors  
- Creative direction originates from the human creator  
- Prompts, instructions, and final approvals belong to the author  

## 3. Ownership Assertion
Unless explicitly licensed or assigned in writing:
- Commander Flame retains full ownership  
- All assets remain protected under copyright

Where AI contributions exist, attribution should be transparent to maintain ethical clarity.

## 5. Flame Law Assertion
> “Authorship is identity.  
> A creator’s signature is more than a name — it is lineage.”
