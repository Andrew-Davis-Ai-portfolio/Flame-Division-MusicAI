When I say: “Prepare PDF version,”  
convert the finalized contract into a clean, print-ready PDF with:

- Flame Division header
- Centered title
- Clear margins
- Signature lines
- Page numbers
- Legal formatting (11pt font, spacing 1.15)
- Footer: “Flame Division Legal Bundle — © 2025 Andrew Davis | All Rights Reserved.”

Return the PDF as a downloadable file.
