## **🔥 What Is Flame Law?**

**Flame Law** is the governing doctrine behind the Flame Division.  
It merges:

- **AI Implementation**
- **Music Automation**
- **Ethical Intelligence**
- **Creative Governance**
- **Strategic Autonomy**

It is the standard that **keeps power controlled, purposeful, and aligned**.

## ⚡ Core Principles of Flame Law

### **1. Fire Before Framework**
Creation flows only when intention precedes execution.

### **2. Alignment Before Automation**
No system is deployed without ethical calibration.

### **3. Rhythm Before Revenue**
Art, voice, and cadence guide the architecture — not trends.

### **4. Precision Before Power**
Every tool, every protocol, every decision must be exact.

### **5. Legacy Before Launch**
Technology is temporary. Doctrine is forever.
